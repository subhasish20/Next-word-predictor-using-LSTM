# ✨ Next-word-predictor-using-LSTM ✨

🚀 **Next-word-predictor-AI** is an intelligent text prediction model built using **Deep Learning**.  
It predicts the **next possible word** in a given sentence using an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network**.  

---

## 📖 Overview
- 🧠 Uses **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)** with **LSTM layers** for sequential learning.  
- ✍️ Trained on text data to understand **language context** and **word dependencies**.  
- 🔮 Predicts the most probable **next word** given an input sentence.

## ⚡ Features
- ✅ Text preprocessing (tokenization, padding, sequences).  
- ✅ Embedding layer for word representation.  
- ✅ LSTM architecture for sequence modeling.  
- ✅ Predicts next word for user-provided sentences.
